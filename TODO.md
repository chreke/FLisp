# TODO

- if
- Closures
- Handle string escape codes
- Macros
  - Macro expansion needs to be performed before `eval`
- Variadic function arguments
  - Add "rest" argument
- Use a better testing library; xUnit is not very ergonomic
- Throw on mismatch between provided args and args list

# DONE

- def (have to return a new environment)
- fn
- Get debugging working in VSCode
- Unwrap Symbol - using "string" as environment keys is fine
- Get the CLI test runner working (I just needed to run it in the right project ðŸ˜›)
- Print values
